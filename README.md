A little tool I threw together ass a quick little pet project. 

I needed a quick dictionary reference tool that could get me definitions quickly without having to provide any kind of 'enter' or 'submit function.

Do other tools like this exist? Probably. But, I used this as an opportunity to practice some with html, css, and javascript to build a static website and host it via Github.
